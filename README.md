post your work on GitHub

# Description:
First, fork a repository to get your own copy of a template for this project from the Udacity repo, and then clone it to your local computer. Add your bikeshare.py file, data file, and a .gitignore file to exclude the data file from version control tracking. 

Next, create a branch "documentation" using Git to make some changes to the project. In this branch, add project documentation in a README file, and make improvements to your docstrings for the bikeshare.py file. The, push your commits back up to the remote repository.
