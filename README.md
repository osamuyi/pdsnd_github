# Project Title:
post your work on GitHub

# Description:
First, fork a repository to get your own copy of a template for this project, and then clone it to your local computer. Your first task will then be to add your bikeshare.py file, data file, and a .gitignore file to exclude your data file from version control tracking. 

Next, create a branch "documentation" using Git to make some changes to your project. In this branch, add project documentation in a README file, and make improvements to your docstrings for your bikeshare.py file. Then you'll push your commits back up to the remote repository.

Thirdly, create a "refactoring" branch to modify your bikeshare.py file to make improvements to the efficiency or readability of your code. 

Finally, merge both branches to the master branch, and push it back up to the remote repository.
